Project: text classification
/src/ : folder containing the source files and a src_README
/data/: folder containing the raw_data and processed_data. 
	Please note that the subfolder should be empty and will be populated when running the main code in /src/
	However I have already populated the processed_data subfolder in order to allow the user to use the 
	npl classifiers I have trained with 1500 * 3 songs.
