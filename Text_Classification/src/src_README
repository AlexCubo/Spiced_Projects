In the src/ folder you find the source codes of this Text Classification project:

1. main_lyric_classifier: 
main code. Reads the page of the artists, extrapolates the songs, cleans them, vectorizes and trains.
Four combinations are created: CountVec + LogReg, TfidfVec + LogReg, CountVec + RandFor, and TfidfVec + RandFor.
		
2. lyric_header:
header file containing the functions used by main. The function extract_lyric_page is in range(10) just to avoid
		to write too many songs in the ../data/data_raw/.
 
3. predict_text: 
predict if a song snipped was written by one of the artists chosen in training. 
Usage: from command line launch with 2 arguments
	First arg: cl, tl, cr, tr (for one of the for vec+classif combination)
	Second argument: snippet (e.g: "True blue, baby I love you")
