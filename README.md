## Gapminder
 The project analyzes one of the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) projects by [Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling).

I selected few countries (Argentina, canada, Italy and Vietnam) and plotted the life expectation vs fertility rate in 50 years. The dimension of scattered point is proportional to the population.
The population legend must be multiplied by 10 millions.

* Life Expectancy vs. Fertility:

## Surviving Titanic
The project is a classification problem. The aim is to train and test different machine learning models to predict the surviving probability of passengers of the RMS Titanic, during the tragedy of 15 April 1912.

I trained the data with Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest and made a comparison of the three models for training and test data:
